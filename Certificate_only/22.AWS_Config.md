# 🧩 What is AWS Config?

**AWS Config** is a fully managed **compliance and configuration tracking service** that:

* Continuously **monitors**, **records**, and **evaluates** the configurations of AWS resources.
* Tracks **resource changes** over time (who changed what, when, and how).
* Allows you to **audit compliance** with internal or external governance rules.

It’s an essential part of **auditing**, **security**, and **operational visibility** in production environments.

## ⚙️ How AWS Config Works

### 1. **Configuration Recorder**

* Monitors AWS resources in your account and **records their configuration history**.
* Captures metadata like:

  * Tags
  * IAM policies
  * Security groups
  * Network settings

### 2. **Delivery Channel**

* Sends recorded data to an **S3 bucket**.
* Optionally integrates with **Amazon SNS** to notify you of changes.

### 3. **Rules Engine**

* Evaluates recorded configurations against **custom or managed rules**.
* Rules check for compliance (e.g., "S3 buckets must have encryption enabled").
* You can use **AWS Lambda** to define **custom logic**.

## 🔍 Key AWS Config Features

| Feature                         | Description                              |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Snapshot of Configuration**   | Point-in-time view of resource state     |
| **Change Tracking**             | Records config changes over time         |
| **Compliance Auditing**         | Detect violations against rules          |
| **Timeline View**               | See the evolution of a resource          |
| **Integration with CloudTrail** | See who made a change                    |
| **Aggregators**                 | View config data across regions/accounts |
| **Remediation**                 | Auto-remediate non-compliant resources   |

## 🛠️ Production Use Cases

### 1. **Compliance Monitoring**

* Enforce rules like:

  * All EC2 instances must use encrypted volumes
  * Only approved AMIs are allowed
  * IAM policies should not allow `*:*`

### 2. **Security Auditing**

* Track changes in:

  * Security Groups
  * IAM Roles & Policies
  * S3 bucket permissions

### 3. **Operational Governance**

* Detect misconfigurations:

  * Public RDS instances
  * EC2 without tags
  * EBS volumes unattached for too long

### 4. **Automated Remediation**

* Combine with **AWS Systems Manager Automation Documents** or **Lambda** to fix issues automatically.

Example: If an S3 bucket becomes public, auto-remove `public-read` permission.

## 🧪 Compliance Rule Examples (Managed Rules)

| Rule Name                                  | Description                                      |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `s3-bucket-server-side-encryption-enabled` | Ensures encryption is enabled                    |
| `ec2-instance-no-public-ip`                | Checks EC2 does not have public IP               |
| `iam-user-no-policies-check`               | Ensures IAM users have no inline policies        |
| `restricted-ssh`                           | Ensures port 22 is restricted in Security Groups |
| `rds-storage-encrypted`                    | Checks RDS encryption status                     |

## 🧠 Best Practices (Production-Ready)

| Best Practice                                           | Why It Matters                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Enable AWS Config in **all regions**                    | Ensures full visibility              |
| Use **Aggregators** for multi-account orgs              | Centralize data                      |
| Use **encrypted S3 buckets** with tight access controls | Secure delivery                      |
| Enable **SNS notifications**                            | Alert on changes                     |
| Store config data in **Glacier or S3 IA**               | Cost-effective retention             |
| Use **AWS Config + CloudTrail** together                | Get full audit trail                 |
| Schedule **remediation with Lambda or SSM**             | Ensure compliance drift is corrected |

## 💡 DevOps/CI-CD Usage Ideas

* Validate configurations post-deploy (e.g., `config-rule-check` after Terraform apply).
* Auto-remediate drifted resources before every release.
* Integrate into **security gates** in pipelines (fail pipeline if rule fails).
* Log and visualize with **Athena + QuickSight** dashboards.
