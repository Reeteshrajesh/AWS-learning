# 🔹 Overview of AWS Cost Tools

AWS provides multiple tools to help manage and optimize your costs:

| Tool                       | Purpose                                          |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **AWS Budgets**            | Set custom cost and usage budgets and get alerts |
| **Cost Explorer**          | Visualize, analyze, and track spending patterns  |
| **AWS Pricing Calculator** | Estimate costs before deployment                 |
| **Cost Anomaly Detection** | AI-based alerts for unusual spending             |

## 🔹 1. AWS Budgets (Cost, Usage, Reservation, and Savings Plans)

### ✅ Use Cases:

* Set a **monthly budget** (e.g., \$1,000 for dev environment)
* Get alerts when spending exceeds 80%
* Track **RI and Savings Plan** utilization
* Budget based on linked accounts, tags, or service type

### 🔧 Configuration Steps:

1. Go to **Billing Console** → AWS Budgets
2. Click **Create budget**:

   * Choose **Cost Budget**
   * Define period: Monthly/Quarterly/Annually
   * Choose linked accounts, services, tags, etc.
   * Set threshold alerts (e.g., 80% email alert)
3. Set **SNS Topic** for budget alerts

### 📌 Best Practices:

* Automate alerts using **SNS → Lambda → Slack/email**
* Use **tag-based budgets** for team or project-level tracking
* Create **usage budgets** to limit API calls, EC2 hours, etc.

## 🔹 2. Cost Explorer

### ✅ Key Features:

* View cost trends over time (daily/monthly)
* Analyze costs by:

  * **Service**
  * **Region**
  * **Usage Type**
  * **Linked Account**
  * **Tag**
* Forecast future costs using historical data
* Download reports as CSV

### 📊 Typical Views:

* EC2 cost by instance type
* S3 storage growth trends
* Lambda vs API Gateway cost comparison
* Reserved Instance savings analysis

### 📌 Best Practices:

* **Enable hourly granularity** for detailed monitoring
* Use **“Amortized cost” view** to understand RIs/Savings Plans
* Create **custom reports** for FinOps teams
* Monitor **data transfer charges** between AZs or regions

## 🔹 3. AWS Pricing Calculator

### ✅ Use Cases:

* Pre-deployment cost planning
* Compare On-Demand vs Reserved vs Savings Plans
* Share cost estimates with business stakeholders

### 📌 Examples:

* Estimate cost of:

  * EKS cluster with 5 nodes, 2 vCPUs, 8 GB RAM each
  * Lambda function with 10M monthly invocations
  * RDS (Postgres) with 100 GB storage + backups

### 🛠️ How It Works:

1. Go to [calculator.aws.amazon.com](https://calculator.aws.amazon.com)
2. Choose services (e.g., EC2, S3, Lambda)
3. Input configuration: region, usage, storage, data transfer
4. Review monthly cost breakdown
5. Export or share public estimate link

## 🔹 Automation Ideas

| Scenario                                    | Toolchain                               |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Alert when cost exceeds 80% of budget       | Budgets + SNS + Lambda                  |
| Weekly spend summary to Slack               | Cost Explorer + Athena + Lambda         |
| Tag-based budget per microservice           | AWS Budgets + Cost Allocation Tags      |
| Auto-scale down Dev EKS cluster on weekends | Cost Explorer Insights → Lambda trigger |

---

## 🔐 Governance and Controls

* Use **IAM policies** to control who can access billing and budgets
* Enable **cost allocation tags** and enforce tag usage with **Service Control Policies**
* Set **organization-level budgets** via AWS Organizations

---

## 🔍 Cost Anomaly Detection

* AI-powered
* Create **monitors per service or account**
* Integrates with **SNS** to send notifications
* Great for catching spikes in Lambda, NAT Gateway, or S3 usage
