# Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)

Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets (EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses) in one or more Availability Zones (AZs).

---

## Types of Load Balancers

### 1. **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**

* Operates at Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS)
* Content-based routing: URL, host-based routing
* Supports WebSocket
* Native support for containerized applications (ECS/EKS with dynamic port mapping)
* Target types: Instance ID, IP, Lambda
* Path-based routing (e.g., `/api` to one target group, `/images` to another)

### 2. **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**

* Operates at Layer 4 (TCP, TLS, UDP)
* Extreme performance: Millions of requests per second
* Static IP support
* Preserves source IP
* Use case: Gaming, IoT, real-time systems

### 3. **Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)**

* Operates at Layer 3 (IP)
* Used with third-party virtual appliances (e.g., firewalls, packet inspection)
* Combines transparent network gateway and load balancing
* Works with VPC endpoints (interface type)

### 4. **Classic Load Balancer (CLB)**

* Legacy option
* Operates at both Layer 4 and Layer 7
* Not recommended for new workloads

---

## Core Concepts

### Target Groups

* Logical group of targets (EC2, IPs, Lambda)
* Health checks are defined per target group
* ALB/NLB routes traffic to healthy targets only

### Listeners

* Check for connection requests from clients
* Each listener has rules to forward requests to target groups
* For ALB: Can use conditions like host/path for forwarding

### Health Checks

* Determines if targets are healthy before sending traffic
* Configurable protocol, port, path (for HTTP)
* Failures cause traffic rerouting to healthy targets

---

## Security

* Supports HTTPS termination with SSL certificates (managed by ACM)
* ALB/NLB can be placed in front of private subnets
* Security groups are used to control access
* Integration with WAF (Web Application Firewall)

---

## Integration with Auto Scaling

* ELB automatically adds/removes instances in ASG
* Health checks at ELB level ensure bad instances are removed
* Dynamic scaling becomes seamless

---

## Logging & Monitoring

### Access Logs

* Enabled for ALB and CLB (not NLB)
* Stored in S3
* Useful for debugging and traffic analysis

### CloudWatch Metrics

* Request count, target response time, healthy/unhealthy hosts

### AWS X-Ray

* ALB integrates with X-Ray for tracing

---

## Pricing

* Based on:

  * Hours load balancer runs
  * Number of LCU (Load Balancer Capacity Units)
  * Data processed

---

## Use Cases

* Web applications with HTTP/HTTPS (ALB)
* Microservices and container workloads (ALB)
* Real-time, latency-sensitive apps (NLB)
* Third-party firewall/VPN appliances (GWLB)

# Core ELB Concepts and Components

This section provides detailed information about the key components used across various Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) types in AWS, including ALB, NLB, and GWLB (where applicable). Each component plays a crucial role in how traffic is received, routed, secured, and balanced across backend services.

---

## 🔷 Target Groups

Target Groups define **where and how traffic is routed** by the ELB.

### Key Points:

* A **Target Group** is a logical collection of backend targets such as:

  * EC2 instances
  * IP addresses (within VPC or on-premises via Direct Connect)
  * AWS Lambda functions (only supported with ALB)
* Each target group is associated with:

  * **Protocol & Port** (e.g., HTTP:80, HTTPS:443, TCP:3306)
  * **Health Check configuration**
* ELBs **route traffic only to healthy targets** within a group.
* A single load balancer can have **multiple target groups**, useful for path-based or host-based routing (ALB only).

### Use Case Example:

ALB routes `/api/*` to `API-TargetGroup` and `/app/*` to `Frontend-TargetGroup`.

---

## 🔶 Listeners

Listeners act as the **entry point** for client connections to the ELB.

### Key Points:

* A **Listener** is a process that checks for incoming connection requests on a specified **protocol and port** (e.g., HTTP:80, HTTPS:443).
* Upon receiving a request, the listener evaluates its **rules** to determine how to route the traffic.
* For **ALB**, listener rules support:

  * Host-based routing (e.g., `app.example.com`)
  * Path-based routing (e.g., `/admin`, `/user`)
  * Header, method, query string conditions
* For **NLB**, listener rules are simpler: they forward traffic to the specified target group.

### Example:

An HTTPS listener on ALB listens on port 443 and forwards requests to a target group based on the URL path.

---

## 🟢 Health Checks

Health Checks monitor the **availability and responsiveness** of targets.

### Key Points:

* **Configurable per target group**:

  * Protocol (HTTP, HTTPS, TCP)
  * Port (e.g., 80, 443, or traffic port)
  * Path (for HTTP/HTTPS, e.g., `/healthz`)
* Health check status determines **whether a target receives traffic**.
* **Unhealthy targets** are temporarily removed from the load balancing rotation.
* Health checks help maintain **high availability and failover** behavior.

### Example Configuration:

* Protocol: HTTP
* Port: traffic port
* Path: `/health`
* Healthy threshold: 3
* Unhealthy threshold: 2

---

## 🔒 Security

Security is enforced at multiple layers of the ELB.

### Key Points:

#### 1. SSL/TLS Termination (HTTPS)

* **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** and **Network Load Balancer (NLB)** support SSL termination.
* SSL certificates can be managed using **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)**.
* ELB handles the decryption, offloading the burden from backend services.

#### 2. Placement & Access Control

* ELBs can be placed in **public or private subnets** depending on access requirements.
* Common pattern: ELB in public subnet → targets in private subnets.
* Use **security groups** to control inbound/outbound traffic:

  * ALB: Supports security groups.
  * NLB: Does **not support security groups** (relies on target-level security).

#### 3. Web Application Firewall (WAF)

* AWS WAF integrates **only with ALB**.
* Protects against common web exploits (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
* Supports rule-based traffic filtering (IP, GeoMatch, rate limiting, etc.)
