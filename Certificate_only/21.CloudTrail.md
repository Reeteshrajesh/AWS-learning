# AWS CloudTrail

## What is AWS CloudTrail?

AWS CloudTrail is a service that enables governance, compliance, operational auditing, and risk auditing of your AWS account. With CloudTrail, you can log, continuously monitor, and retain account activity related to actions across your AWS infrastructure.

## Key Features

* **Event History**: View activity history of your AWS account for actions taken through the AWS Management Console, SDKs, command-line tools, and other AWS services.
* **Multi-Region Logging**: Capture events across all AWS regions.
* **Data Events**: Record high-volume API activity on S3 objects and Lambda functions.
* **Management Events**: Log account-level operations such as IAM changes, security group updates, and EC2 actions.
* **CloudTrail Insights**: Detect unusual operational activity in your AWS account.
* **Integration with Amazon S3 and CloudWatch Logs**: Store logs in S3, monitor in CloudWatch.
* **Encryption**: Supports AWS KMS encryption for log files.

## How It Works

1. **Create a Trail**: You can create a trail to deliver log files to an S3 bucket.
2. **Events Recorded**: API calls from console, SDKs, CLI, etc. are recorded.
3. **Log Delivery**: Logs are delivered to your specified S3 bucket.
4. **Analyze Logs**: Use Athena, CloudWatch Logs, or third-party tools for analysis.

## Use Cases

* **Security Auditing**: Track changes to security groups, IAM policies, etc.
* **Operational Troubleshooting**: Investigate failed logins, resource deletions, and modifications.
* **Compliance**: Prove compliance with regulations by showing a detailed history of changes.
* **Forensics**: Reconstruct timeline of activities during a security incident.

## Best Practices

* **Enable CloudTrail in All Regions**
* **Use Separate S3 Bucket with Least Privilege**
* **Enable CloudTrail Insights for Anomaly Detection**
* **Integrate with AWS Organizations for Centralized Logging**
* **Enable Log File Validation**
* **Encrypt Logs Using KMS**
* **Set Lifecycle Rules on S3 Buckets to Control Costs**

## Pricing

* **Management Events**: Free for the most recent 90 days of activity.
* **Data Events**: Charged based on number of events recorded.
* **Insights Events**: Charged based on number of analyzed write management API calls.

## Advanced Topics

* **Integration with AWS Config**: For deeper configuration auditing.
* **Real-Time Monitoring with CloudWatch Alarms**: Trigger alerts for suspicious activities.
* **Athena Queries on S3 Logs**: Serverless querying of CloudTrail logs stored in S3.
* **Log Aggregation with Amazon OpenSearch**

## Sample Athena Query

```sql
SELECT eventTime, eventName, userIdentity.userName, sourceIPAddress
FROM cloudtrail_logs
WHERE eventSource = 'ec2.amazonaws.com'
AND eventName = 'StartInstances'
ORDER BY eventTime DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

# üîê Advanced Production-Level CloudTrail Information

### 1. **Multi-Trail Strategy**

* **Single trail vs multiple trails**: In production, organizations often have:

  * A **global organization trail** (via AWS Organizations) for compliance.
  * **Separate trails per OU/account** for specific audit or operational needs (e.g., dev, prod).
* You can have **one multi-region trail** and multiple **single-region trails** for performance and cost control.

---

### 2. **Integration with AWS Organizations**

* Use **CloudTrail Organization Trails** for centralized logging across accounts.
* Automatically applies the trail to all **new and existing accounts** in your org.
* IAM roles/policies must allow CloudTrail to write to a central S3 bucket from child accounts.

---

### 3. **Security Best Practices**

* Enable **log file validation** to detect tampering (SHA-256 digest file + digest S3 bucket).
* **Encrypt logs at rest** using **SSE-KMS** for better control and audit of access.
* Restrict **S3 bucket access** using:

  * Bucket policies
  * VPC endpoints
  * Service control policies (SCPs) if using AWS Organizations

---

### 4. **Monitoring and Alerting**

* Integrate with:

  * **Amazon CloudWatch Logs** to create metric filters and alarms
  * Example: Trigger alarm when `ConsoleLogin` or `DeleteTrail` is logged
  * **Amazon Athena** or **CloudTrail Lake** to perform SQL queries on logs
* Use **AWS Config** and **GuardDuty** alongside CloudTrail for advanced threat detection.

---

### 5. **Retention & Cost Optimization**

* Use **Object Lifecycle Rules** on S3 buckets to move logs to **Glacier/Deep Archive**.
* Only store **management events** in some environments; **data events** are expensive (e.g., for S3 and Lambda).
* Use **EventSelectors** to control which types of events are captured.

---

### 6. **Data Event Logging Tips**

* **Data Events** capture object-level activity (e.g., `GetObject`, `PutObject` in S3).
* They‚Äôre disabled by default ‚Äî selectively enable for:

  * Specific S3 buckets with sensitive data
  * Specific Lambda functions that need close auditing

---

### 7. **CloudTrail Lake**

* Serverless, managed **event data lake** for querying, analyzing, and retaining events without needing to manage Athena, S3, or Glue.
* Ideal for:

  * Forensics
  * Long-term compliance audits
  * Security analysis
* **Retention configurable up to 7 years**.

### 8. **Use Case Scenarios**

| Use Case                      | CloudTrail Capability                                          |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Detecting suspicious activity | Monitor `ConsoleLogin`, `CreateUser`, `AttachRolePolicy`, etc. |
| Enforcing compliance          | Export trails to external SIEMs for auditing                   |
| Root cause analysis           | Trace changes made to EC2, IAM, S3, RDS resources              |
| Insider threat detection      | Track anomalous access or misuse of credentials                |
| Operational troubleshooting   | Analyze API call patterns during failures                      |

---

### 9. **Compliance & Forensics**

* Ensure **immutable logging** for regulatory frameworks: HIPAA, PCI-DSS, ISO 27001, SOC2.
* Always **export logs** to a secure, versioned, encrypted S3 bucket with strict access policies.
* CloudTrail supports **FIPS endpoints** in regions that require it.

---

### 10. **CI/CD Integration (Advanced)**

* Integrate CloudTrail with your **CI/CD pipeline security checks**.

  * Alert on unauthorized actions in the pipeline
  * Monitor `CodeBuild`, `CodeDeploy`, `CloudFormation` usage
* Example: Alert when IAM permissions are modified during a deployment.
