# AWS RDS (Relational Database Service) - Deep Dive

## üîç What is Amazon RDS?

Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) is a managed relational database service provided by AWS that simplifies the setup, operation, and scaling of databases in the cloud.

It supports several database engines:

* **Amazon Aurora (MySQL/PostgreSQL compatible)**
* **MySQL**
* **PostgreSQL**
* **MariaDB**
* **Oracle**
* **SQL Server**

---

## üß± Core Components

### 1. **DB Instance**

* An isolated database environment in the cloud.
* Can be Single-AZ or Multi-AZ.
* Can be provisioned (standard) or serverless (Aurora).

### 2. **DB Subnet Group**

* Defines which subnets (within a VPC) your DB can be deployed into.
* Required for high availability and proper networking.

### 3. **Parameter Group**

* Acts like a config file for your database engine.
* Includes engine-specific options (e.g., `max_connections`, `innodb_buffer_pool_size`).

### 4. **Option Group**

* Add optional features like Oracle TDE, SQL Server Agent, etc.

### 5. **Security Groups**

* Acts as a virtual firewall.
* Controls access to the DB instance.

### 6. **Snapshots & Backups**

* **Automated backups**: Retain up to 35 days.
* **Manual snapshots**: Persist until you delete them.
* Used for point-in-time recovery.

### 7. **Monitoring & Logs**

* **CloudWatch** for metrics.
* **Enhanced Monitoring** for OS-level visibility.
* **RDS logs**: Error, Slow Query, Audit (depends on engine).

# üß± Additional RDS Concepts (Deep Dive)

### **DB Instance (Detailed)**

* A **DB instance** is the core component in RDS; it is where the actual database engine runs.
* You can select instance types (e.g., `db.t3.medium`, `db.m5.large`) based on:

  * **vCPUs**
  * **Memory**
  * **Networking performance**
* Supports:

  * General purpose (SSD), provisioned IOPS, or magnetic storage
  * **Burstable performance** for smaller workloads (`t` instances)

---

### **DB Subnet Group (Detailed)**

* A **DB Subnet Group** is a collection of subnets that RDS uses to deploy instances.
* Requirements:

  * Minimum **2 subnets** in **2 different Availability Zones** (for high availability)
* Use Cases:

  * Ensures database is placed in the **private subnet**
  * Works with **VPC Peering**, **Transit Gateway**, or **PrivateLink**

---

### **Parameter Group (Detailed)**

* Custom settings for the database engine.
* Changing values:

  * **Dynamic parameters**: Apply immediately
  * **Static parameters**: Require DB restart
* Examples:

  * `max_connections`, `log_bin_trust_function_creators`, `work_mem`
* You can clone default parameter groups to customize
