## Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)

### What is EBS?

Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) provides persistent block storage volumes for use with EC2 instances.

### Key Features:

* **Durable and Persistent:** Data persists independently of EC2 instance lifecycle.
* **Types of EBS Volumes:**

  * gp3 (General Purpose SSD)
  * io2 / io1 (Provisioned IOPS SSD)
  * st1 (Throughput Optimized HDD)
  * sc1 (Cold HDD)
* **Snapshots:** Incremental backups stored in Amazon S3.
* **Encryption:** At-rest and in-transit encryption using AWS KMS.
* **Resizable:** Can increase size, change volume type, or adjust IOPS without downtime.

### Use Cases:

* Databases (io2)
* Boot volumes (gp3)
* Data warehousing (st1)

### Limitations:

* Bound to single AZ. To use in another AZ, create a snapshot and restore.

## Amazon EFS (Elastic File System)

### What is EFS?

Amazon EFS is a scalable, elastic, cloud-native NFS file system.

### Key Features:

* **Shared File System:** Multiple EC2 instances can mount EFS simultaneously.
* **Scalable:** Automatically grows/shrinks as files are added/deleted.
* **Performance Modes:**

  * General Purpose (default)
  * Max I/O (for high throughput)
* **Throughput Modes:**

  * Bursting
  * Provisioned
* **Encryption:** At-rest and in-transit.
* **Access Points:** For providing restricted access to specific directories.

### Use Cases:

* Web servers
* Content management systems
* Shared home directories for EC2 instances

### Limitations:

* Slightly higher latency than EBS
* Requires EC2 instances in the same VPC

## Instance Store

### What is Instance Store?

Instance Store provides temporary block-level storage for EC2 instances.

### Key Features:

* **Ephemeral Storage:** Data is lost if the instance is stopped or terminated.
* **High IOPS:** Good for temporary storage such as cache or buffer.
* **Included in EC2 Cost:** No extra cost beyond instance price.

### Use Cases:

* Buffer/cache
* Temporary files
* Scratch data

### Limitations:

* Not persistent
* Cannot be resized or backed up like EBS
