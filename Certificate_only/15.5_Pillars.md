* Implement **least privilege** using IAM roles and policies.
* Encrypt data **at rest and in transit** using AWS KMS.
* Use services like **AWS WAF**, **GuardDuty**, **Macie**, **Security Hub**.
* Enable **MFA** and **log access with CloudTrail**.

### üîç Goals:

* Prevent and detect threats
* Respond quickly to incidents
* Protect systems and data from unauthorized access

---

## üõ°Ô∏è 3. Reliability

### ‚úÖ Focus Areas:

* Automatic recovery
* Distributed design
* Change and failure management

### üìå Key Practices:

* Design for **fault tolerance** (e.g., multi-AZ, load balancing).
* Implement **health checks**, auto healing (e.g., Auto Scaling groups).
* Use **Amazon Route 53** for DNS failover and traffic routing.
* Monitor with CloudWatch and alert using SNS.

### üîç Goals:

* Keep systems running during failure
* Test recovery procedures regularly
* Adapt and recover from disruptions

---

## üíµ 4. Cost Optimization

### ‚úÖ Focus Areas:

* Cost-effective resources
* Measuring efficiency
* Eliminating waste

### üìå Key Practices:

* Use **Savings Plans** and **Spot Instances**.
* Implement **auto scaling** to match demand.
* Right-size instances and storage.
* Analyze spend with **AWS Cost Explorer** and **Budgets**.

### üîç Goals:

* Avoid unnecessary expenses
* Optimize ROI
* Enable cost-aware architecture decisions

---

## ‚ö° 5. Performance Efficiency

### ‚úÖ Focus Areas:

* Optimized resource allocation
* Innovation with evolving technology

### üìå Key Practices:

* Use **serverless** (Lambda, Fargate) when possible.
* Use **Amazon CloudFront** to cache and deliver content globally.
* Choose right compute (EC2, ECS, EKS, Lambda).
* Enable **Auto Scaling**, DB read replicas, and caching (e.g., ElastiCache).

### üîç Goals:

* Deliver high performance under varying loads
* Evaluate and evolve with new AWS services
* Use global infrastructure to reduce latency
